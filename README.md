## Project Update

This project is closed now and I am not contributing to this committing to anymore on this repo. It was created in early days of development, when I started learning android, git an github.

I have very little time to contribute on it, but will continue to contribute on other repos. I am keeping this repo only because it was my first repo on github. I also start learning [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using this repo.

Now I am working on [VidiT](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.d4devz.apps.videoediting.vidit).

**This is CLOSED now**
